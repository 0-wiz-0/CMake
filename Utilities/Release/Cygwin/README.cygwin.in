Build instructions:
  unpack @CYGWIN_SRC_PACKAGE_NAME@.tar.bz2
    if you use setup to install this src package, it will be
         unpacked under /usr/src automatically
  cd /usr/src
  ./@CYGWIN_PACKAGE_NAME@.sh

This will create:
  /usr/src/@CYGWIN_PACKAGE_NAME@.tar.bz2
  /usr/src/@CYGWIN_SRC_PACKAGE_NAME@.tar.bz2

-------------------------------------------

Port Notes:

The directory /usr/share/@CPACK_CYGWIN_NAME@/include is purposely not
located at /usr/include/@CPACK_CYGWIN_NAME@ or /usr/include/cmake.  The
files it contains are not meant for inclusion in any C or C++ program.
They are used for compiling dynamically loadable CMake commands inside
projects that provide them.  CMake will automatically provide the
proper include path when the files are needed.
