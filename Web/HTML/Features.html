    <font size=5>A Summary Of Features</font><br> CMake is an extensible, 
    open-source system that has several powerful features. These include:
    <ul>
      <li>Supports complex, large build environments. CMake has been
          proven in several large projects.</li>
      <li>Generates native build files (e.g., makefiles on Unix;
          workspaces/projects on MS Visual C++). Therefore standard
          tools can be used on any platform/compiler configuration.</li>
      <li>Has powerful commands include the ability to locate
          include files, libraries, executables; include external
          CMake files that encapsulate standard functionality;
          interfaces to testing systems; supports recursive
          directory traversal with variable inheritance; can run
          external programs; supports conditional builds; supports
          regular expression expansion; and so on.</li>
      <li>Supports in-place and out-of-place builds. Multiple
          compilation trees are possible from a single source tree.</li>
      <li>Can be easily extended to add new features.</li>
      <li>CMake is open source.</li>
      <li>CMake operates with a cache designed to be interfaced with
          a graphical editor. The cache provides optional interaction
          to conditionally control the build process.</li>
