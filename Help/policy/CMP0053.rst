Always write the output of file(GENERATE).

CMake 3.0 and lower always writes the output file specified in a
:command:`file(GENERATE)` command, even if the content is unchanged.

The OLD behavior for this policy is for the :command:`file(GENERATE)`
command to always write the to the output file.  The NEW behavior for
this policy is to write the output file only if the content to be written
is different.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.1.
CMake version |release| warns when the policy is not set and uses
``OLD`` behavior.  Use the :command:`cmake_policy` command to set it
to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.
