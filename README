CMakeLists.txt contains the following:

EXECUTABLES =
# make flags
# make flags can use these varibles:
# ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}  The root of the build tree where the binaries are
# ${CMAKE_SOURCE_ROOT} The root of the source tree where configure is

Windows / Visual Studio 6.0 programs
CMakeSetup.exe      -> window MFC based GUI for configure on windows
CMakeSetupCMD.exe   -> windows command line version of CMakeConfigure
To Build on Windows:
load CMake/Source/CMakeSetup.dsw
Build it
Run it
Specify paths

Load ITK.dsw
Build Common, Numerics, then any of the many executables, or do a Batch build 
with debug only.


Unix scripts and programs:
configure             -> run on unix to configure for build
CMakeBuildTargets     -> Unix program to read CMakeLists.txt and generate CMakeTargets.make
makefile fragments:
CMakeMaster.make      -> main file to be included by makefiles
CMakeVariables.make   -> all make varibles are set in this file
CMakeRules.make       -> All build rules are here (except Simple Rules)
CMakeSimpleRules.make -> simple build rules for .o to .cxx, this is separate to be able
to build CMakeBuildTargets itself.
CMakeLocal.make       -> Place for hand configuration
CMakeTargets.make     -> generated rules for make style build in each directory
MakefileTemplate.make -> master makefile template used by configure to generate Makefiles

Unix install:
In place:
./configure
make

Other directory:
mkdir Insight-build
cd Insight-build
../Insight/configure
make


TODO:
configure stuff for windows should be a copy configure file
read in depend regular expression from a file
